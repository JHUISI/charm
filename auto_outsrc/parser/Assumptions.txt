-- Master public values, master secret values, and secret values must be returned as lists of items.  Use
dummy variables if only one variable in a given scheme.

-- each line with at least one pairing contains only pairings, no other calculations

-- last line of decrypt is assignment of message itself, and the calculation can only be an operation
on at most two variables

-- in Decrypt, for loops must run from 0 to their length, NOT entries in a different dictionary.  If the
keys must be entries in a different dictionary, the first statement of the for loop can contain that
assignment.

-- doNotIncludeInTransformList in config.py must be completed.  Right now, the only thing you'd include here
is the name of a variable that stores the results of a dot product computed in a for loop.

-- dot products using "dotprod" cannot contain blinded variables, only unblinded variables.

-- elements of the secret key shouldn't be given as lists if they have a predetermined number of entries
(e.g., D#0, D#1, and D#2).  Instead, break them up into separate variables (e.g., D0, D1, and D2).
